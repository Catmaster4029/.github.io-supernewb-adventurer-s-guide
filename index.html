    <p> Hello there fellow pixel dungeoneers! Do you die a lot when playing with many active challenges? Do you or a loved one suffer from chronic newbieness? If you answered yes to either of those questions then it's time for you to git gud! And you've come to the right place. These guides have been created as a more permanent way for me to display all the various tips and tricks I have for players. I've beat this game more times than I'm proud of and with experience comes knowledge and a lot of it at that. People often ask for "general advice" which honestly I find to be the toughest type to give in any meaningful way. At least to people who already know the basics and commonly repeated tips. So I've instead opted to thoroughly cover individual subjects of the game. What started as a single small guide has now evolved into a larger series! Though I certainly took my time doing it I've managed to finish 8 chapters! </p>
